					After facing a significant health challenge that led me to reevaluate
					my career path, I made the decision to transition into web
					developmentâ€”a field I've always been passionate about. Highly
					motivated and detail-oriented, I've completed comprehensive diplomas
					in both Front-End and Full-Stack Development, equipping myself with
					the skills needed to build modern web applications. Through hands-on
					project experience and continuous learning, I've developed a strong
					foundation in creating responsive, accessible, and performant websites
					that deliver exceptional user experiences.
